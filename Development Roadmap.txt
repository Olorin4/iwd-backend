   - Set up Redis for caching and real-time communication.



### Phase 1: Backend Build-Up (ETA: 4 Weeks)

1. **API Development and Real-Time Communication:**

   - Build Node.js backend using Express.js and Prisma ORM.
   - Implement RESTful APIs for CRM integration, job management, and driver tracking.
   - Load board integration for finding and managing loads
   - Set up Socket.IO for real-time communication.
   - Store real-time data (e.g., driver location) in Redis.

2. **Core Business Logic and Authentication:**

   - Implement Clean Architecture with Core Domain Layer and Use Cases Layer.
   - Implement RBAC using Casl for fine-grained permission management.
   - Integrate Auth0 for OAuth2 and OpenID Connect authentication.

3. **Database Models and Repositories:**

   - Design database schema using Prisma.
   - Implement repositories for data persistence in PostgreSQL.

4. **Testing and Quality Assurance:**

   - Unit and integration tests using Jest.
   - API testing with Postman or Jest-Supertest.



### Phase 2: Core Features (ETA: 6 Weeks)

**Hours of Service (HOS) Integration:**

- Design and implement HOS calculation and validation APIs.
- Store driver logs and duty statuses in PostgreSQL for historical tracking and auditing.
- Implement real-time HOS alerts for drivers and dispatchers using Socket.IO.
- Ensure compliance with federal/state regulations (e.g., FMCSA in the U.S.).

1. **Integration with CRM and Workflow Orchestration:**

   - Integrate CRM workflows using APIs built in Phase 1.
   - Automate client onboarding, invoice creation, and email notifications.
   - Use React Query for efficient server state management.

2. **Job Assignment and Status Management:**

   - Utilize established backend services for job assignment and status tracking.
   - Design frontend workflows and notifications for job status updates.

3. **Real-Time Driver Tracking and Map Updates:**

   - Use Socket.IO for real-time communication of driver locations.
   - Store driver location data in Redis for fast access and updates.
   - Display on map using **Google Maps API** or **React Leaflet** with **OpenStreetMap**.
   - Implement live movement updates and geofencing alerts.

4. **Job Assignment and Status Management:**

   - Design workflow for job assignment, status tracking, and notifications.
   - Use transactional consistency in PostgreSQL for job status updates.

5. **User Authentication and RBAC:**

   - Integrate Auth0 for OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.
   - Implement RBAC using Casl for fine-grained permission management.



### Phase 3: Frontend Development (ETA: 4 Weeks)

**Note:** Frontend development should begin only after Phase 2 (Core Features) has established stable APIs, core business logic, and data models. This ensures a reliable backend foundation, reduces rework, and enables seamless integration between frontend and backend.

1. **Component Architecture:**

   - Modularize React components for reusability across Electron and React Native.
   - Implement Context Bridge in Electron for secure system-level access.

2. **UI and State Management:**

   - Build UI components using React.
   - Manage server state with React Query and local UI state with React Hooks.

3. **Map-Centric GUI Development:**

   - Integrate real-time updates using Socket.IO for live location tracking.
   - Choose between Google Maps API for advanced features or React Leaflet with OpenStreetMap for cost-effective implementation of map rendering and interactivity.
   - Implement draggable markers for job assignment and status updates.

4. **User Authentication and Authorization:**

   - Integrate Auth0 React SDK for OAuth2 authentication.
   - Implement RBAC using Casl for fine-grained permission management.

5. Frontend Integration and User Experience:

   Integrate frontend components with backend APIs for seamless user experience.

   Implement error handling and loading states for real-time features.



### Phase 4: Enhancements and Optimizations (ETA: 4 Weeks)

**Fuel Optimization and Cost Calculation:**
   - Fetch real-time fuel prices from external APIs (e.g., GasBuddy, OPIS).
   - Calculate optimal fuel stops and estimated costs for routes.
   - Track state-wise mileage for IFTA tax calculation.
   - Fetch state-wise tax rates and calculate total IFTA liability.
   - Generate compliance reports for IFTA audits.
\*\*

1. **Additional TMS Features:**

   - Advanced reporting, route optimization, multi-language support.

2. **Caching and Performance Improvements:**

   - Implement Redis caching and optimize database queries using Prisma.

3. **Observability and Monitoring Integration:**

   - Implement Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and custom dashboards.



### Phase 6: Future Enhancements (ETA: TBD)

**ELD Integration:**

- Consider ELD integration after MVP launch to support automatic HOS logging.
- Start with a single ELD provider for reduced complexity, then scale to multiple providers.
- Ensure compliance with FMCSA standards, including certification and testing.
- Address security and privacy requirements for ELD data transmission and storage.
